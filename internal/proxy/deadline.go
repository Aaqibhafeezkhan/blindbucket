// defaultStallTimeout is how long a transfer may make no progress at all.
//
// Deadlines are renewed as bytes move rather than set once as a global
// WriteTimeout, and the distinction is the point: a 5 TiB download is a
// legitimate request that may run for hours, while a connection that has moved
// no bytes for a minute is not slow, it is stuck. A fixed WriteTimeout cannot
// tell those apart; a renewed one does not have to.
//
// The floor this implies is worth stating. The deadline covers one Write, which
// carries up to a chunk -- 64 KiB by default -- so a client reading more slowly
// than roughly 1 KiB/s will be cut off. That is well below any link worth
// serving, and far enough below it that a legitimately slow reader is not at
// risk.

// httptest's recorder, or a wrapper that does not unwrap -- disables the guard
// for that request instead of breaking it. The gateway's own wrapper implements
// Unwrap so that http.ResponseController can reach the connection through it.
