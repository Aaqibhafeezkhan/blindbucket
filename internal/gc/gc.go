// Package gc collects orphaned multipart manifests.
//
// A manifest becomes an orphan whenever an object version stops being visible
// without its manifest being removed: a single-part PUT over a multipart object
// (which skips the HEAD deliberately, to keep the common write path cheap), an
// upload that crashed or was aborted, a DeleteObjects batch. Orphans hold no
// plaintext and cost only storage, but they accumulate.
//
// Deleting them is the dangerous half. A manifest that looks orphaned may belong
// to an upload that is about to complete, and removing it produces exactly the
// failure invariant I1 forbids: a visible multipart object that nothing can read.
// The order below is rule R4 from ADR-010, it is checked by the
// model in spec/tla/Multipart.tla, and two of its steps are load-bearing in ways
// that are not obvious from reading them:
//
//  1. List the manifests of the key.
//  2. ListMultipartUploads; if anything is open for that key, skip it entirely.
//  3. HEAD the object for the manifest id in use right now.
//  4. Delete the listed manifests that are neither current nor younger than a
//     minimum age.
//
// Steps 1 and 2 both only read, and swapping them breaks the invariant: the
// model finds a counterexample in twelve states, because a check that runs
// before the listing says nothing about manifests written after it. Listing
// first is what gives the check its meaning.
